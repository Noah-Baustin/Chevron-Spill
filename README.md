# Chevron Spill Website

### The Project:

This is a customized website I built using html and css. It was my final project in the Intro to Coding course at the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism, taught by Jeremy Rue.

You can view the final website online [here](https://noah-baustin.github.io/Chevron-Spill/).

The course covered a broad range of front end web development concepts, including the HTML and CSS languages, design principles and using the Boot Strap framework.

The code for this website utilizes a template originally developed by professor Jeremy Rue. The content for the site is based off of a story I reported with In Jeong Kim for Richmond Confidential in March 2021. You can view the original story [here](https://richmondconfidential.org/2021/03/03/what-caused-chevron-pipeline-to-leak-diesel-into-bay/).
